# Flight Price Prediction Project

This project involves training an XGBoost model on a dataset of flight information to predict the prices of flights. The dataset includes various features such as the source, destination, number of halts, departure time, arrival time, and more.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of flights based on several features. We use an XGBoost model due to its high performance and ability to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to flights. These features help in predicting the flight prices accurately. The key features are:

- **Source**: The starting point of the flight.
- **Destination**: The endpoint of the flight.
- **Number of Halts**: The number of stops the flight makes.
- **Departure Time**: The time when the flight departs.
- **Arrival Time**: The time when the flight arrives.
- Other relevant features.

## Features
The dataset contains the following features:

- `Source`
- `Destination`
- `No of Halts`
- `Departure Time`
- `Arrival Time`
- And other relevant features that can impact flight pricing.

## Model
We use the XGBoost model for predicting flight prices. XGBoost is a scalable and efficient implementation of gradient boosting framework by Friedman. It has proven to perform well on structured/tabular data.

## Results
The model has been trained and tested on the provided dataset, showing promising results with a good balance between bias and variance. Detailed evaluation metrics can be found in the `results` folder.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any improvements or bug fixes, please create a pull request or open an issue.
